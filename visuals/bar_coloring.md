# Bar coloring

Source: https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/bar-coloring/

The `barcolor()` function colors bars on the main chart, regardless of whether the script is running in the main chart pane or a separate pane.

The function’s signature is:

```
barcolor(color, offset, editable, show_last, title, display) → void
```

The coloring can be conditional because the `color` parameter accepts “series color” arguments.

The following script renders *inside* and *outside* bars in different colors:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("barcolor example", overlay = true)
isUp = close > open
isDown = close <= open
isOutsideUp = high > high[1] and low < low[1] and isUp
isOutsideDown = high > high[1] and low < low[1] and isDown
isInside = high < high[1] and low > low[1]
barcolor(isInside ? color.yellow : isOutsideUp ? color.aqua : isOutsideDown ? color.purple : na)
```

Note that:

- The `na` value leaves bars as is.
- In the `barcolor()` call, we use embedded `?:` ternary operator expressions to select the color.
